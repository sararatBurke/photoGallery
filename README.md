Mobile Web Development Final Project using React - Native

Recreation of a Website from Colorlib Website Template :https://preview.colorlib.com/#photon

Requirements: 

Should be an Expo React Native App

The ‘Portrait’ view of the App should be the same as the “mobile” view that is provided for your chosen website.

The ‘Landscape’ View should be the same as the “tablet” view that is provided for your chosen website. 

Your site should change based on screen size (For this -it is suggested you use npm package “React-Native-Size-Matters”) in a way that is effective for bigger and smaller screens -even tablets. 

You must have 1 Video accessible from your site (it can be a “dummy” video). If your site has a Carousel you do not have to implement the Carousel - However this might be a good place to input a Video.  

You should have a Stack Navigator being used in your site. There should be a menu “hamburger” or a “more” button in the upper right of the Stack Navigator heading which opens up a “DrawerNavigator.” 

There should be a Drawer Navigator (which contains all menu items) that houses all of the pages on your site.
